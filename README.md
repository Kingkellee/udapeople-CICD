## Give your Application Auto-Deploy Superpowers

In this project, I showed my understanding of some of concepts of Continuous Integration, Continuous Deployment and Continuous delivery:

In the Project I:

- Explained the fundamentals and benefits of CI/CD to achieve, build, and deploy automation for cloud-based software products. See ![Proposal Presentation](presentation.pdf)
- Utilized Circle Ci to design and build CI/CD pipelines that support Continuous Delivery processes.
- Utilized Ansible a configuration management tool, Cloudformation to accomplish deployment to cloud-based servers.
- Prometheus, Alertmanager and Node Exporter for monitoring Surface critical server errors and diagnosis using centralized structured logging.
